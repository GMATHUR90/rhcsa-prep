**Create and Manage Hard Link:**

inode(Index Node) : content metadata about file or directory, but not it names or content.

Example: library catalog:

- book title: file name
- catalog card : detail about book(author , ISBN, location ) is like inode

Metadata of inode:

1. File type 2. Permissions 3. Owner 4. Group 5. Size 6.Timestamps 7. Link Count 8. Pointers

stat: file system status

![Hard_link_5](rhcsa_images/Hard_link_5.png)

Hard Link: A hard link is like creating a second name for the same file. Both the original file and hard link point to same data on disk.

| ln <path_to_target_file> <path_to_link_file> | Hard link |
| --- | --- |

Soft Link: A soft link is like a shortcut to another file or directory. It pointâ€™s to the file location rather than file itself.

# Shell Script Basics

## 1. What is a Shell Script?

A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that are executed by the shell (the command-line interpreter). It automates repetitive tasks, configures environments, or executes multiple commands in a specific order without user interaction.

## 2. Step-by-Step Process to Create a Shell Script

### Step 1: Plan the Script
Before writing a shell script, it is important to have a clear understanding of what you want the script to achieve. Write down the steps and the associated commands needed to complete the task.

### Step 2: Create the Script File
- Use a text editor to create a new file (e.g., `print_hello_world.sh`).
- Add the shell commands you need in the file in the order you want them executed.

### Step 3: Add Commands to the Script
Add the series of commands inside the script that were executed in the last lab or your planned task.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World..."
# Add additional commands as needed
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable
To execute the script, you can either run it using the `bash` command or configure it to run as an executable file.

#### Option 1: Execute using `bash`
Run the script directly using:
```bash
bash print_hello_world.sh
```

#### Option 2: Make it Executable
Remove the `.sh` extension and configure the script to run like a system command. Use the following command to make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x print_hello_world
```

### Step 5: Handle Command Not Found Error
If you try to run the script and see a "command not found" error, it means the OS can't find the script in the systemâ€™s PATH environment variable.

### Step 6: Add the Script to PATH
To resolve the error, append the directory containing your script to the PATH variable:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/script
```

This allows you to run the script from any location as a normal command.
